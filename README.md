# ItemizedSw

This is the Swift version of Itemized. The program adds items to inventory and then prints out how many items you have. You can specify how many items to add by passing a number as an argument. If you don't specify any items, you will receive one item. 

Yes, it's very simple. That's the idea.

## Example

```
$> .build/debug/Itemize
You have:
  An item
$> .build/debug/Itemize 4
You have:
  Four items
$> .build/debug/Itemize 42
You have: 
  42 items
```
